# FirstSnakeImplementation
This is my first try to implement a classic snake game using the console.

The snake can move in all directions (up, down, right, left). If you try to go through yourself (bite yourself) or hit
a wall a message with your mistake will appear. If you try to go to the opposite direction (ex. if you are moving to the right 
and press the left button) nothing will happen (your move will be ignored). You can eat food which spawns in a different
place everytime you eat it. The game follows the clasic snake game rules so you also get bigger and faster when you eat food.
The snake does not have a maximum size but i implemented a minimum console delay time so at some point you will reach the
maximum speed of the snake (if you are good enough). After you die some messages will appear besides the one which describes the
reason of your death. If you have scored a new highscore you will be asked to enter your name and it will be stored in a Highscore.txt file with the top three scores at this moment. After that the highscore table will be printed on the console with the top 3 players so you don't have to check the .txt file all the time to check if you are the best. In the end you wil be asked for another game and depending on the answer you give you will start to play again or not. 

Good luck and have fun testing it!

P.S: If you find a bug in the game please e-mail me at: simonradev@gmail.com. Thank you!

# FirstSnakeImplementation
This is my first try to implement a classic snake game using the console.

The snake can move in all directions (up, down, right, up). If you try to go through yourself (bite yourself) or hit
a wall a GameOver exception will appear with a message depending on the situation. You can eat food which spawns in a different
place everytime you eat it. The game follows the clasic snake game rules so you also get bigger and faster when you eat food.
I dont have a maximum size of the snake but i implemented a minimum console delay time so at some point you will reach the
maximum speed of the snake (if you are good enough).

Good luck and have fun testing it!

P.S: If you find a bug in the game please e-mail me at: simonradev@gmail.com. Thank you!
